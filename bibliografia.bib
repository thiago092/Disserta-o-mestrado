abstract = {We proposed a novel efficient method for 3D left ventricle (LV) segmentation on echocardiography, which is important for cardiac disease diagnosis. The proposed method effectively overcame the 3D echocardiography’s challenges: high dimensional data, complex anatomical environments, and limited annotation data. First, we proposed a deep atlas network, which integrated LV atlas into the deep learning framework to address the 3D LV segmentation problem on echocardiography for the first time, and improved the performance based on limited annotation data. Second, we proposed a novel information consistency constraint to enhance the model’s performance from different levels simultaneously, and finally achieved effective optimization for 3D LV segmentation on complex anatomical environments. Finally, the proposed method was optimized in an end-to-end back propagation manner and it achieved high inference efficiency even with high dimensional data, which satisfies the efficiency requirement of clinical practice. The experiments proved that the proposed method achieved better segmentation results and a higher inference speed compared with state-of-the-art methods. The mean surface distance, mean hausdorff surface distance, and mean dice index were 1.52 mm, 5.6 mm and 0.97 respectively. What’s more, the method is efficient and its inference time is 0.02s. The experimental results proved that the proposed method has a potential clinical application for 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography.}

abstract = {Automatic semantic segmentation in 2D echocardiography is vital in clinical practice for assessing various cardiac functions and improving the diagnosis of cardiac diseases. However, two distinct problems have persisted in automatic segmentation in 2D echocardiography, namely the lack of an effective feature enhancement approach for contextual feature capture and lack of label coherence in category prediction for individual pixels. Therefore, in this study, we propose a deep learning model, called deep pyramid local attention neural network (PLANet), to improve the segmentation performance of automatic methods in 2D echocardiography. Specifically, we propose a pyramid local attention module to enhance features by capturing supporting information within compact and sparse neighboring contexts. We also propose a label coherence learning mechanism to promote prediction consistency for pixels and their neighbors by guiding the learning with explicit supervision signals. The proposed PLANet was extensively evaluated on the dataset of cardiac acquisitions for multi-structure ultrasound segmentation (CAMUS) and sub-EchoNet-Dynamic, which are two large-scale and public 2D echocardiography datasets. The experimental results show that PLANet performs better than traditional and deep learning-based segmentation methods on geometrical and clinical metrics. Moreover, PLANet can complete the segmentation of heart structures in 2D echocardiography in real time, indicating a potential to assist cardiologists accurately and efficiently.}

abstract="Ultrasound tracking of organs or target volumes is a promising means to correct the displacement caused by respiration and errors from repositioning in medical applications e.g. in radiation therapy. However, one major problem of ultrasound images is their inherent low contrast and clutter which often makes standard algorithms instable for this purpose. In this work we present the adaption and application of a probabilistic tracking approach based on conditional density propagation (condensation) for real-time tracking on ultrasound images. This approach promises to facilitate robust real-time tracking with 5 degrees of freedom (translation and scaling in x-/y- direction, rotation) of anatomic structures on noisy and low contrast ultrasound images. The real-time performance and precision of the algorithm are investigated with ultrasound data from the liver. The tracking results of the algorithm are compared with results obtained from image registration. It is shown that this algorithm is real-time capable with processing time less than 5 ms per frame and robust on low contrast target structures with a precision below 1.6 mm in translation. Compared with an independent image co-registration method, this method leads to a superior displacement correction in pre-delinated target structures.",

In the field of medical image analysis, transformers have also been successfully used in to full-stack clinical applications, including image synthesis/reconstruction, registration, segmentation, detection, and diagnosis. This paper aimed to promote awareness of the applications of transformers in medical image analysis. Specifically, we first provided an overview of the core concepts of the attention mechanism built into transformers and other basic components. Second, we reviewed various transformer architectures tailored for medical image applications and discuss their limitations. Within this review, we investigated key challenges including the use of transformers in different learning paradigms, improving model efficiency, and coupling with other techniques. We hope this review would provide a comprehensive picture of transformers to readers with an interest in medical image analysis.}

abstract = {The Transformer network is the main application area for natural language processing. It has gained traction lately and exhibits potential in the field of computer vision. This cutting-edge method has proven to offer a significant impact on image analysis, a crucial area of computer vision. The transformer's outstanding performance in vision computing places it as an alternative to the convolutional neural network for vision tasks. Transformers have taken center stage in the field of natural language processing. Despite the outstanding performance of transformer networks in natural image processing, their implementation in medical image analysis is gradually gaining roots. This study focuses on the transformer application in natural and medical image analysis. The first part of the study provides an overview of the core concepts of the attention mechanism built into transformers for long-range feature extraction. The study again highlights the various transformer architectures proposed for natural and medical image tasks such as segmentation, classification, image registration and diagnosis. Finally, the paper presents limitations identified in proposed transformer networks for natural and medical image processing. It also highlights prospective study opportunities for further research to better the computer vision domain, especially medical image analysis. This study offers knowledge to scholars and researchers studying computer vision applications as they focus on creating innovative transformer network-based solutions.}
